Scaled Up Web Infrastructure

To design a scalable infrastructure, we'll incorporate separate servers for the web server, application server, and database, along with a load balancer configured as a cluster. Here's the breakdown:

Server Setup:

We'll add one additional server, bringing the total to two servers.
Each server will be dedicated to a specific component:
Server 1: Web Server
Server 2: Application Server + Database Server
Load Balancer (HAProxy):

HAProxy will be configured as a load balancer cluster, managing traffic distribution between the two servers.
This setup ensures high availability and fault tolerance by allowing multiple instances of HAProxy to work together, eliminating a single point of failure.
Split Components:

Web Server: Handles HTTP requests, serves static files, and acts as a reverse proxy to the application server.
Application Server: Executes application logic, processes dynamic content, and interacts with the database.
Database Server: Stores and manages data used by the application.
Specifics about the Infrastructure:

Load Balancer Cluster:

Adding a load balancer cluster improves scalability and reliability by distributing incoming traffic across multiple servers.
It eliminates a single point of failure and ensures uninterrupted service even if one load balancer instance fails.
Split Components:

Separating components onto dedicated servers enhances performance, scalability, and security.
It allows each component to scale independently based on demand and reduces contention for resources.
Why We're Adding It:

Load Balancer Cluster:
To evenly distribute incoming traffic and prevent overload on any single server.
To ensure high availability and fault tolerance by eliminating single points of failure.
Split Components:
To optimize resource allocation and improve scalability.
To enhance security by isolating components and reducing attack surface.
